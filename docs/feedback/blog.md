# Blog Process Effectiveness

**Project:** SQL Query Agent with Ollama
**Author:** Alberto
**DSM Sections Referenced:** 2.5.6 (Blog Deliverable Process), 2.5.7 (Publication Strategy), 2.5.8 (Blog Post as Standard Deliverable)

## Purpose

Track blog materials collected during the project and evaluate how well the DSM blog workflow works in practice. This feeds into the blog post drafts at end of each sprint and the final project blog.

| Architecture decisions | LangGraph graph design, schema filtering rationale | Pending |
| Model comparison results | sqlcoder:7b vs llama3.1:8b evaluation | Pending |
| Error patterns | Common failure modes and how the agent handles them | Pending |
| Screenshots/outputs | Notebook outputs, evaluation tables | Pending |

### Sprint 2

| Material | Description | Status |

## Blog Topics / Angles

*Ideas captured during development:*

1. "Building a Text-to-SQL Agent with Local LLMs" -- the main project narrative
2. Research-driven development: how surveying state of the art changed the architecture
3. Model comparison: SQL-specialized vs general-purpose LLMs for code generation
4. Evaluation methodology for LLM-generated code

## Observations on DSM Blog Workflow

*To be populated as we follow the process.*
