    "# SQL Query Agent with Ollama - Exploration Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sprint 1 Deliverable** | **DSM 1.0 Track**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds and evaluates a natural language to SQL agent using open-source LLMs running locally via Ollama. It serves as a text-to-code generation testbed -- SQL is a constrained language ideal for systematic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:** LangGraph state graph with schema filtering, SQL validation (sqlglot), and error-correction retry loop. Design informed by DIN-SQL, MAC-SQL, and CHESS research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "1. Verify environment (Ollama, models, database)\n",
    "2. Build LangGraph agent: `schema_filter` → `generate_sql` → `validate_query` → `execute_query` → `handle_error`\n",
    "3. Evaluate at least 2 models (sqlcoder:7b vs llama3.1:8b) on a curated test suite\n",
